This course is about using space strategically in relation to business needs. While no businesses succeed based on their architecture or space design, many fail as a result of inattention to the power of spatial relationships. The course demonstrates through live case studies with managers and architects the value of strategic space planning and decision making. We will explore the organizational self-evaluation necessary to know what you need or want from your space. The course presents conceptual frameworks for thinking about architecture, communication and organizations. We will present examples of success and failures. Thought leaders from industry and academia will introduce the latest ideas in this field.
